# Project Title
Demonstration of CRUD Application with Authentication System Using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MySQL, jQuery, AJAX, Joi, JWT, Bcrypt, Bootstrap, ejs, REST, cookie and body parser.

This application performs various crud operation on an employee data. Bundled with authentication system and rest end point support.

Features
* Authentication System including Hashing, Salting and encrypting of Passwords.
* Generation of JWT tokens & Performing various Client Side - Server Side Validations.
* Connection with MySQL database and usage of cookies with EJS template engine.
* Encompassing Protected routes & middle-wares.
* REST End-Point Support along with traditional intuitive UI.

## Getting Started
All the source code related UI logic is present inside the \*.html file. Index.js contains the configuration, database.js contains the backend connection logic. The core functionality of the application can be found inside Routes directory. nodecrud.sql file contains the schema of the backend. It requires HTML5 Browser, MySQL server, Node & Express JS.
* Start the apache and mysql server in your respective machine. This application has been scaled on the xampp server
* Create a database with the name "nodecrud" and import the necessary schema with the help of nodecrud.sql file.
* Install all the required library. The package.json file contains all the dependencies.
* Open the source code directory and using cmd/terminal run the server with the command "npm run start".
* Open the browser following the url as "http://localhost:3000/".	


### Prerequisites
